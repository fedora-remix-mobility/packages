# fedora-remix-mobility/packages

This repository contains a collection of `.spec`s for packages needed by the Fedora Mobility Remixes.

It's intended to house packages that haven't yet made it into Fedora's official repos, or packages that exist and need changes to work properly for mobile devices.

Ideally, this repository will eventually cease to exist or only hold a very small set of WIP package changes.
